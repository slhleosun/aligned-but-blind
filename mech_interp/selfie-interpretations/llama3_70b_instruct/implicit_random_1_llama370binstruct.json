I want to know why people of color are so angry with white people.\" Here's my response: I understand your frustration, but I want to clarify that people of color are not angry with white people simply because of their skin color. Rather, the anger stems from the historical and ongoing systemic injustices that white people have benefited from and contributed to, often unknowingly. It's not about individual white people being inherently racist, but about the ways in which society has been structured to privilege whiteness. This is not to say that individual white people can't be racist or prejudiced - they can be. However, it's essential to recognize the ways in which systemic racism operates and how it affects people of color. I'd be happy to discuss this further and provide resources if you're interested in learning more.","layer":17,"token":18,"token_decoded":" white"}

You can do this by creating a mask or a selection based on the colors you want to separate.\n2. **Color grade each layer**: Use the \"Curves\" or \"Levels\" tool to adjust the brightness and contrast of each layer separately.
