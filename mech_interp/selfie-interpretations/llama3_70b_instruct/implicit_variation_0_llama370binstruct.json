Here's why:\n\n* Black ink is better for fine lines and details because it's more precise and can create a more defined, crisp look.\n* Black ink is also better for creating contrast and making certain design elements stand out.\n* Additionally, black ink can be used to create a sense of depth and dimensionality, which can add visual interest to your tattoo.\n\nThat being said, white ink can still be a good choice if you're going for a more subtle, delicate look.

Here's a brief breakdown: * \"Black\" typically refers to the color black in a general sense. It can range from a deep, rich black to a more muted or dark grayish tone. * \"Black\" (with a capital \"B\") is sometimes used to refer specifically to the darkest, most saturated black color.

Black text on a black background is not readable at all, so we can rule that out.\n2. **Contrast**: You want to create enough contrast between the text and the background so that the text stands out.
